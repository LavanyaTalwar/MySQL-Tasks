TASK 1

The objective of this task is to create a database structure for IPL fixture and results for next year. We have to store the following data in the database:
Venue of match
Date of match
Team 1 name
Team 2 name
Captain of team 1
Captain of team 2
Toss won by
Match won by

For this task we will proceed with the following steps:
Firstly I will create a database names 'sqltasks' using command 

CREATE DATABASE sqltasks;

This command will create a database with name sqltasks.
Now since the database has been created we need to start using the database.
For this we will use the command 

USE sqltasks;

Now since in the database we need to create a fixture
so we will create tables
here we will create a table that contain all the match detals like venue, date , team 1 and team 2 name , captains of team1 and team2.
Also we will create another table that contains the result of match and winner of toss.
Also both the tables have a common entry as match_id which will be used as a primary key.
For this following commands will be used:

Create table table1(
match_id int primary key,
venue varchar[20] ,
date date,
team1 varchar[20],
team2 varchar[20],
capt_team1 varchar[20],
capt_team2 varchar[20]
);

Create table table2(
match_id int primary key,
winner_toss varchar[20],
winner_match varchar[20]
);

We can enter dummy values in this aswell like

+----------+-----------+----------+------------+------------+------------+
| match_id | team1     | team2    | capt_team1 | capt_team2 | date       |
+----------+-----------+----------+------------+------------+------------+
|        1 | rajasthan | mumbai   | A          | B          | 2024-01-01 |
|        2 | delhi     | banglore | C          | D          | 2024-01-02 |
|        3 | chennai   | gujrat   | E          | F          | 2024-01-03 |
+----------+-----------+----------+------------+------------+------------+


pros:
1. This is a simple way of representing complex data.
2. This divides the match details and result in different tables so as to maintain isolation of tables.

cons:
1. The table can be futher more reduced by creating 3 tables instead of 2.
2. The table could have been more simple.
